# Ritik Lakhwani

I am a backend developer. I build APIs, real-time systems, and backend services that are meant to run in production, not just demos.

I mostly work with Node.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Redis, and WebSockets. I care about clean APIs, predictable behavior, and systems that hold up under load. I also work with blockchain when it makes sense, mainly on the backend side.

## Projects

**Real-Time Quiz Platform**  
Built a live quiz system using WebSockets. Users receive questions in real time, submit answers, and get results instantly. Authentication is handled using JWT and role-based access.

**Contest Platform Backend**  
Built a role-based backend with strict API contracts. Enforced time limits, submission rules, and validations.

**DEX Data Aggregation Service**  
Aggregates token prices from multiple DEX APIs. Uses Redis for caching and WebSockets to stream live updates.

**Order Execution Engine**  
Built a backend service to process orders concurrently. Handles retries, queues, and real-time status updates over WebSockets.
