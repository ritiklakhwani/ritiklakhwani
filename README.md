## üèÜ Hackathon Highlights

### ü•á ETHGlobal Bangkok : Winner of $2070 Prize  
*Project:* [ZK Credit Score](https://github.com/ritiklakhwani/zk-credit-score-eth-global-bangkok)  
A privacy-first credit scoring system using zero-knowledge proofs. It evaluates cross-chain wallet activity and generates a Web3 credit score, without exposing any personal or financial data. Built for smarter, safer DeFi.

### ETHGlobal Singapore  
*Project:* [InspectorAI](https://github.com/Krane-Apps/inspector-ai-eth-singapore-2024)  
AI tool that reviews and analyzes smart contracts across different blockchains. It detects vulnerabilities and provides detailed insights to help developers ship more secure dApps.

### ETHGlobal Online  
*Project:* [BlockGood](https://github.com/umershaikh123/blockGood)  
A decentralized donation tracking platform designed to make charitable giving transparent. Every donation is recorded and traceable on-chain, so donors can trust where their funds go.
